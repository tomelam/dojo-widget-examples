# Installation of Dojo widgets built as custom elements

Use https://dojo.io/learn/custom-elements/introduction as a starting point.

1. Clone the Dojo widget examples:
`git clone https://github.com/dojo/examples`

2. Edit the .dojorc in the widget's or app's directory.

3. Make the scripts executable:
`chmod +x build* test*`

4. Run a script, for example:
`./test-cli-tools.sh`
`./build-world-clock.sh`
